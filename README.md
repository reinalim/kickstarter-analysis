# Written Analysis of the Results
## 1. Overview of Project
The purpose of analysis provides a visualization of outcomes based on campaign goals and launch dates to demonstrate how different campaigns fared in relation to their goals and launch dates. 
## 2. Analysis and Challenges
I performed my analysis using the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals chart(image) to compare the relation to campaign goals and launch dates and also by comparing how the successful, failed, canceled plays affect their goals and launch date. 

## 3. Results
### Two conclusion are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
* The chart demonstrates, the plays launched most successfully is between April to Aug especially in the month of May which it hits the highest point and follow by June, which shows the second highest.

* The canceled plays does not seems to be affected much by launch date. The successful plays is more affected by launch date compared to the failed and canceled plays in the theater. 

### One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals

   ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://github.com/reinalim/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
* When the fundrasing goals is between $45,000 to $49,999, the percentage of successful plays is 0% and the percentage of failed is 100%. There is no canceled plays.
### There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommendation for addtional tables or graphs
The limitations of the dataset are the type of theater outcomes and lack of play details specifically play type. The analysis was performed based on the outcome type of successful, failed and cenceled plays from the month of January to December. However, there was an addtional outcome type "live", which was not included in the analysis. Also, having the type of plays available in the dataset could have demonstrated stronger and clear analysis. For example, a table/graph that demonstrate how different type of plays is successful/failed/conceled or affected by launch date and compaign goals. This would help Louise to plan her fundrasing in more effective way for future years.
